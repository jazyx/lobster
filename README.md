An app to use for guessing game.

A person, place or thing will be chosen at random. Different players will see different items.

Three modes of play:
1. Each player shows their phone screen to all the other players, but cannot see what is on their own phone. Players take turns to ask a question that will help identify the item. If the answer to the question is "Yes", they get to ask another question. If not, the turn moves to the next player. If you correctly identify your item, you win a point and choose a new one.

2. One player looks at their own phone, and all other players are allowed to ask "Yes/No" questions. The other player who guesses the right answer wins a point.

3. The player who is looking at their phone has to describe the item without naming it. They have one minute for their turn. If another player guesses the item, the speaker wins a point, and starts to describe the next item. Their turn ends after one minute.
